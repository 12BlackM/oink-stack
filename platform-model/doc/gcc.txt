GCC is required for preprocessing; it is also used as a compiler just to check
that source files are valid.

You should preprocess all files to be analyzed using the same compiler version
on the same system.

The declarations for some system functions differ per system.

The declarations and definitions for the C++ library vary depending on the
compiler version.

Elsa's template parser can currently handle STL headers from gcc-3.4, but not
gcc-3.3 or gcc-4.0.

For C-only, other versions of gcc will work.  If you are not using C++, you
can change the following line in Maekfile.src.incl to refer to your compiler:
    COMPILER_CC = gcc-3.4 


Installing gcc-3.4
==================

The procedure for installing gcc-3.4 varies per operating system and
distribution.

On Debian, you can use
    apt-get install g++-3.4

For distributions that don't provide gcc-3.4, see the URL below for
information on installing alternate gcc versions.
    http://www.mjmwired.net/resources/mjm-fedora-gcc.html

You should have a binary called "gcc-3.4" in your PATH; if you have a
different binary you can use a PATH trick:
    mkdir platform-model/bin
    cd platform-model/bin
    ln -s path-to-gcc34 gcc-3.4

    export PATH=/path/to/platform-model/bin:$PATH
