Oink/qual can be built with ARCHIVE_SRZ_ZIP support, which allows reading and
writing .oz/.qz files.  This requires the libzipios++ library.

If Oink was not built with that library, it will by default only have
ARCHIVE_SRZ_DIR support, which creates a directory for each archive file, with
extension .odir/.qdir.

Platform-model can be configured to create a library for either kind of
archive.

Oink-scripts will use either one it finds.
