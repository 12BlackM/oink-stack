<h2>Features You Need to Ask elsa/ccparse For Directly</h2>

<p>The elsa frontend is oink-stack/elsa/ccparse.  The feature of
printing the typechecked AST is provided by Elsa and can be used
directly.

<pre>
  oink-stack/elsa/ccparse -tr printTypedAST foo.cc
</pre>

<p>In general many "-tr" ("tracing flags") that work for elsa also
work for the oink or qual tools; be sure to provide them separately
"-tr blort -tr gronk" rather than the "-tr blort,gronk" which only
Elsa accepts.

<p>Note however that flags implemented in elsa/main.cc will not be
honored by oink or qual because we replace that module with our own
since we have our own main() function.  Here are some introspection
flags that Elsa implements that there simply aren't command-line flags
for in oink and as mentioned the -tr flags won't work from ./oink
either.

<pre>
  -tr parseTree; print the parse tree; a bit obscure to read
  -tr printHierarchies; print the class hierarchies
</pre>

<hr>
<h2>Reading and Writing the The AST and Typesystem as XML</h2>

<p>I implemented reading and writing of the Elsa AST and Typesystem so
that we could have serialization in Cqual++.  You can get an XML view
of the AST and optionally the Typesystem.

<pre>
  -tr xmlPrintAST; print the AST as XML
  -tr xmlPrintAST-types; include type annotations in the XML
  -tr xmlPrintAST-indent; indent the output (slower)
</pre>

<p>The input file oink-stack/elsa/in/t0001.cc:
<pre>
    // very simple

    int x;
</pre>

<p>The start of the 9258 lines of XML output.  You can see the line
length map for the file and the beginnings of the declaration of an
int.

<pre>
    ./ccparse -tr c_lang -tr xmlPrintAST,xmlPrintAST-types,xmlPrintAST-indent in/t0001.cc
...
    &lt;File _id="FI0x83DBE20"
     name="in/t0001.cc"
     numChars="23"
     numLines="4"
     lineLengths="FI0x83DE408"&gt;
     &lt;LineLengths _id="FI0x83DE408"&gt;
    14 0 6 0
     &lt;/LineLengths&gt;
    &lt;/File&gt;
    &lt;TranslationUnit _id="AST0x83E6CB8"
     topForms="AL0x83E6CB8"&gt;
     &lt;List_TranslationUnit_topForms _id="AL0x83E6CB8"&gt;
      &lt;_List_Item item="AST0x83E6D40"&gt;
       &lt;TF_decl _id="AST0x83E6D40"
        loc="in/t0001.cc:3:1"
        decl="AST0x83E6CE0"&gt;
        &lt;Declaration _id="AST0x83E6CE0"
         dflags="(extern &quot;C&quot;)"
         spec="AST0x83E6CC8"
         decllist="FL0x83E6D18"&gt;
         &lt;TS_simple _id="AST0x83E6CC8"
          loc="in/t0001.cc:3:1"
          cv=""
          id="int"&gt;
         &lt;/TS_simple&gt;
</pre>

<p>Elsa will parse it back in again too.

<pre>
  -tr parseXml; parse in XML in the same schema we output it.
</pre>

<p>Oink/Cqual++ makes use of this to do serialization and
de-serialization, so if you analyze and serialize a file foo.i using
Cqual++ and look in the resulting foo.qdir/value directory you will
see the same XML augmented with serialization for the Abstract Value
annotations as well.  I just didn't make a command line flag to print
it to standard out.

<p>XML makes a handy debugging output format since it is reasonably
readable and is guaranteed to be complete since we use it for
serialization.  When following object ids as links in the XML you may
find it handy to use the emacs C-s C-w feature for searching for
whatever is in front of the cursor instead of attempting to type in
those ids manually.

<p>The lowered view of the AST is basically the AST after templates
have been instantiated, implicit syntax made explicit, and overloading
resolved; it is the version that you want to look at if you are
analyzing or compiling the code.  See the elsa documentation in
oink-stack/elsa/doc for more details.

<pre>
  -tr xmlPrintAST-lowered; give a "lowered" view of the AST
</pre>

<hr>
<h2>Hashline directives</h2>

<p>If there are <tt># 123 "blort.c"</tt> ("hashline") directives in
your blort.i file (which there will be by default) it means that that
line of blort.i came from line 123 of blort.c.  The elsa source
location module will parse these directives, build an internal map
back to the original .c locations, and use this map to report
locations of things relative to the original file line numbers instead
of the line numbers in blort.i.

<p>foo.c:
<pre>
    #define BOINK b
    int main() {
      BOINK;
    }
</pre>

<pre>
    $ gcc -E foo.c > foo.i
</pre>

<p>foo.i:
<pre>
    # 1 "foo.c"
    # 1 "<built-in>"
    # 1 "<command line>"
    # 1 "foo.c"

    int main() {
      b;
    }
</pre>

<p>Note the change in line number reported for the error.

<pre>
    $ ./oink foo.i
    foo.c:3:3: error: there is no variable called `b'
    . . .
    $ ./oink -tr nohashline foo.i
    foo.i:7:3: error: there is no variable called `b'
    . . .
</pre>

<p>Use this flag to turn that behavior off and get the locations
reported relative to the raw input file.  It works on both elsa and
oink.
<pre>
  -tr nohashline; don't use the preprocessor hashline directives
      to map back to the original file
</pre>

<hr>
<h2>Lexer output</h2>

<p>If you just want to see the token stream from the lexer, use this:

<pre>
    ./tlexer -tr tokens in/t0001.cc
    %%% progress: 0ms: making Lexer
    %%% progress: 1ms: lexing in/t0001.cc...
    in/t0001.cc:3:1: int
    in/t0001.cc:3:5: <name>: x
    in/t0001.cc:3:6: ;
    %%% progress: 7ms: done lexing (4 ms)
</pre>

<hr>
<h2>Using the ubiquitous 'gdb()' method</h2>

<p>AST nodes, types, and variables have a gdb() method designed to be
used to print out an object in a helpful from when traversing the
graph in <tt>gdb</tt> by dumping a human readable representation of
the object.  Just say 'print x->gdb()' from the gdb command prompt.

<p>This is a good way to use your <tt>.gdbinit</tt> file.

<pre>
    file ./oink
    set args ../elsa/in/t0001.cc
    break main
    break breaker
    run
</pre>

<p>It works on AST nodes.

<pre>
    Breakpoint 3, ValueASTVisitor::visitDeclarator(Declarator*) (this=0xbffff650,
        decltor=0x8379958) at value_ast_visitor.cc:33
    (gdb) p decltor->gdb()
    tree = Declarator:
      var: (global) (definition) int x
      context = DC_TF_DECL
      decl = D_name:
        loc = ../elsa/in/t0001.cc:3:5
        name = PQ_name:
          loc = ../elsa/in/t0001.cc:3:5
          name = "x"
      init is null
      ctorStatement is null
      dtorStatement is null
    $1 = void
</pre>

<p>It works on Variables.

<pre>
    (gdb) p decltor->var->gdb()
    int x
    $2 = void
</pre>

<p>It works on Types.

<pre>
    (gdb) p decltor->var->type->gdb()
    int
    $3 = void
</pre>


<hr>
<h2>Serial numbers</h2>

<p>Tracking dependencies through the heap can be a big pain: Sometimes
you have <ul>

<li>an object that is in a corrupted state and you want to watch it being created, however

<li>that was on a previous pass through the AST and the stack frames
of those routines have popped and are gone.

</ul>

<p>When built with USE_SERIAL_NUMBERS, any object whose class inherits
from class SerialBase will get an 'int serialNumber' field; these are
currently: (elsa) Scope, the heirarchy of Types, Variable, and (oink)
Value.  You can use the serial number mechanism to go "backward in
time" in gdb as follows:
<ul>

<li>at the location of the object you wish to witness being created,
use gdb to print its serial number field
<pre>
  p x->serialNumber
</pre>

<li>set a breakpoint at the global serial number creation function
<pre>
  b incSerialNumber (suppose its breakpoint 3)
</pre>

<li>condition that breakpoint to stop when the global serial number is
the one printed above
<pre>
  cond 3 globalSerialNumber == 4756 (whatever the print output)
</pre>

<li>re-run the program.
<pre>
  run
</pre>

</ul>

<p>To do this for two objects, just create two breakpoints at the same
place in serialno.cc and condition each breakpoint on its respective
serial number.

<p>One instance of the Cqual++ tool can create objects and serialize
them to a file, and then another process instance can read them back
in for further analysis.  Therefore it is possible to find a corrupted
object that was created in a process that no longer even exists!  Elsa
therefore consults a file <tt>.serialno</tt> in the local directory to
find out where to start the first serial number.  To debug
multi-process sequences as the one just described, just do as follows.
<ul>

<li>Delete <tt>.serialno</tt> (it will be recreated and start at zero)
at the beginning of the sequence of processes.

<li>When in one process you find an object for which you would like to
find its creation point, print its serial number as before.

<li>Delete <tt>.serialno</tt> again and run the processes in sequence.

<li>When you start the process that increments over the serial number
you are looking for, set the breakpoint as above and run.

</ul>
