<h1>Oink Coding Style</h1>

<p>Daniel S. Wilkerson

<p>These are the Oink coding guidelines.  There is more to say, but I
wasn't sure that saying it would help: it started to sound like I was
attempting to re-write the "Mythical Man-Month".

<p>Please read "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Hunt and Thomas (Addison
Wesley) and "The Practice of Programming" by Kernighan and Pike
(Addison Wesley).

</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>Use two-space indentation and no tab characters.  You may find the
following .emacs code useful if you use emacs.

<pre>
    ;; **** some .emacs bindings to make it easy to imitate the style of elsa/oink
    ;; Make java indentation style the default for all c-like modes.
    (setq c-default-style "java")
    ;; indentation is 2 spaces per level for C and C++
    (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook
              '(lambda ()
                 (setq c-basic-offset 2)))
    (add-hook 'c-mode-hook
              '(lambda ()
                 (setq c-basic-offset 2)))
    ;; Turn off inserting tab characters into your .emacs buffer.  Use only spaces.
    (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
    ;; Get rid of trailing whitespace.
    (setq-default nuke-trailing-whitespace-p t)
</pre>

<p>Please do not fight emacs; the indentation that the above gives you
is what I use.

<p>Use studly caps.

<pre>
    OK: aVarThatCountsBlonks
    not OK: a_var_that_counts_blonks

    You can use underscores as a second-level separator:
    fooBar_stage().
</pre>

<p>Accepted usage of statement block curlies is as follows.

<pre>
    Using curlies is OK:
    if (p) {
      go();
    }

    If it is on one line and is simple and easy to read then OK:
    if (p) go();

    Not using curlies and not being on the same line is NOT OK:
    if (p)
      go();
</pre>

<p>Prefer function block curlies on the same line as the function declaration.

<pre>
    void f() {
      go();
    }
</pre>

<p>Unless the parameters are too long and must be put on their own
line; then put the curly on its own line also.

<pre>
    void f
      (int lots, int of, int parameters, int here)
    {
      go();
    }
</pre>

<p>Put a space after a comma.  Do not put one before unless you are
using my strange constructor initializer list syntax:

<pre>
    Foo()
      : a(3)
      , b("hello")
      , c(57)
    {}
</pre>

<p>Please put declarations and definitions in the same order unless
there is a good reason not to.

<p>If you make a function in a .cc file that is not used outside the
file, then mark it as static; in general I see no reason that an
inline function should not also be marked static unless you are doing
something funky and taking its address and hoping the compiler does
the right thing and makes two copies.  In that case, don't do that:
make an external version that is a thin wrapper around the internal
inline version.

<h2>Design and Hacking</h2>

<p>I had a Czech girlfriend and we went for a skiing vacation in the
Jeseniky Mountains in northern Moravia.  The problem was that I didn't
know how to ski so she introduced me to a Czech guy and said "you
don't know how to ski and he doesn't speak English; he will teach you
to ski and you will teach him English".  Then Blanka skied away.

<p>These guys were just the local fire department; they had just run a
tow-rope up the local hill and their sound system was a radio taped to
the pole playing "you and me baby we ain't nothin' but mammals so
let's do it like they do on the discovery channel".  I slid terrified
down the hill wondering if I was going to stop before I hit the
concrete bunker; I was greeted by some very friendly Czechs who handed
me a beer in one hand and a shot of locally-brewed slivovice (plum
brandy) in the other.  My instructor arched in beautifully in a
sliding sideways stop right in front of me, and as he did, I noticed
something.  Right behind his left heel, the core of the ski was
broken.  It was just flopping up and down as he slid to a stop, held
together by the laminate on the top.

<p>Now I guarantee you that if you go to the U.S. Olympic Training
Center, they might measure your diet and your bio-rhythms and your
precise ski angle as your turn, but one thing I am sure they don't
teach you is how to ski on a broken ski.  These guys had taught
themselves.  These guys were ski-hackers.

<p>In a Computer Science Department, they might teach you proofs and
algorithms and design, but they won't teach you to hack.  A hacker is
one intimate with the machine in a way that goes beyond words.  This
is the essence of engineering.  I have yet to find a place that
teaches it.

<h3>Light and Dark</h3>

<p>In Soto Zen Buddhism top-down design is called "light" and
bottom-up hacking is called "dark". To paraphrase Shunryu Suzuki,
sometimes you study the texts of great masters and sometimes you just
sit and let it all get mixed together in your belly in the dark.  From
the "Merging of Difference and Unity", the Sandokai:

<blockquote>
    <p><a href=http://www.berkeleyzencenter.org/Texts/sandokai.shtml>
    Darkness is a word for merging upper and lower.</a>
    <br>Light is an expression for distinguishing pure and defiled....

    <p>Right in light there is darkness,
    <br>but don't confront it as darkness.

    <p>Right in darkness there is light,
    <br>but don't see it as light.
</blockquote>

<p>That is, there is a place for design (light) and a place for just
hacking (dark); you have to respect both.  I saw this in my xfortune
one day:

<blockquote>
    <p>Everything should be designed top down, except the first time.
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is, with software mostly it is almost always the first
time.  Just build it simply, write the tests, and then refactor it
while keeping the tests working.  It seems slower, but your code will
get built, it will work and you will spend little time in debugging.
Until you have worked on the problem, you won't know what to design
anyway.

<hr>
<h2>Software is code and tests working together</h2>

<p>Software is code and tests working together.  If there aren't any
tests, it isn't software; don't even check it in.

<p>Many people write regression tests of this form.
<ul>
<li>Run the code and have it print out a very verbose representation
of its internal state.  Save that to a file and check it in.
<li>In the future run it again and diff.
</ul>

<p>This methodology is flawed since much of the internal state is
present in the output, most of it irrelevant; when it changes, the
output changes in lots of meaningless ways which have to be confirmed
by hand; this does not scale.  In particular in the output there is
<ul>
<li>trivial information, and
<li>information from multiple aspects.
</ul>

<p>A better scheme arises if you change the way you think about your
program.  Think of it as a database with a query engine.  Whatever your
input is, think of it as some language that your program renders into
a database internally.  Now, augment this language with a query
language to ask questions of that database and an assertion language
for saying how the query should turn out.  Now when you make an input
that is a test, embed assertions about the results of queries mixed in
with the input.  The test is: do the assertions about the queries
about the input all pass?  <ul>

<li>This is testing an assertion about the semantics of the input,
which should change much less frequently.

<li>Additionally, it is much easier to factor the semantics into
various aspects and test aspects separately.

</ul>

<p>For the Cqual++ tests, this is very easy, as there is an implicit
query for any input: do the consequences of the resulting dataflow
graph produce an inconsistent set of constraints?  The qual executable
returns a different exit code to the shell depending on whether an
inconsistency was found or not.  The simplest example is: does
$tainted flow to $untainted?  Now instead of writing tests that print
out what qualifier annotations end up on what variables and
expressions, I can just write a test that takes an input where
$tainted should flow to $untainted and check the return value to the
shell.

<p>In elsa Scott has an extension to C++ called __checkType(a, b) that
simply asserts that a and b are of the same type.  This is a query
against the type-annotated AST; if it fails, the typechecking pass
fails.

<h3>Do Controlled Experiments</h3>

<p>Be sure to do controlled experiments; this good idea has been
emphasized for a long time by the science community.  A
<em>control</em> for an experiment is just another experiment where
all the conditions are the same except for the one you think makes the
difference.

<p>I wrote a script test_filter that implements a simple preprocessor
for doing this.  You may optionally annotate lines of code in a test
with either '// bad' or '// good' comments.  When this test is passed
through test_filter with the flag '-good', only the '// good' lines
and the unannotated lines pass through; similarly with '-bad' only '//
bad' and unannotated lines pass through.  Thus one can maintain a
single test from which are generated two versions that differ only in
the lines that you indicate should make a difference in the result of
the test.

<p>Scott later implemented a different take on in elsa that does an
n-way control, but you can only add lines that should cause a failure,
you cannot subtract them; that is, there is no equivalent of '//
good'.

<hr>
<h2>Orthogonality and Invariants</h2>

<p>Once you have the orthogonality, the factoring straight, the code
writes itself.

<blockquote>
    <p>Show me your flowchart and conceal your tables, and I shall
    continue to be mystified.  Show me your tables, and I won't
    usually need your flowchart; it'll be obvious.

    <p>-- Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man Month.
</blockquote>

<p>An object is an set of invariants with a box around it.  The
methods maintain these invariants.  Comment each class saying what the
invariants are.  Comment each data and function member in the header
file (not the implementation file) saying why it is there.  The best
use of a class is to contain everything related to one aspect of your
program.  One day we will have aspect-oriented programming, but until
then, make object-oriented as aspect-oriented as you can.

<p>It is always a higher priority to refactor existing code than to
add new features.

<h3>Idiom and Good Shape</h3>

<p>Factor code *bottom-up* not *top-down*.  That is the way to factor
code is to pretend that you are pulling out common parts to make a
reusable library.  You don't do this because you might actually re-use
it, but because it makes your code flexible.

<p>There is a concept in the Chinese board game "Go" called "Good
Shape" (http://www.joot.com/go/shape1.html).  The game is so flexible
that you can basically put stones anywhere just as in software you can
basically write anything you want.  This flexibility gives you the
opportunity to get completely tangled and make a mess.  You can't
control the mess, but what you can do is what the Buddhists call
"being upright" in the face of the chaos.  You don't know globally
what the system will do, so just make sure locally, your code is in
good shape: that at least *this* component stands alone and no matter
what happens to it, it itself is solid.

<p>Good shapes are also reminiscent of Design Patterns, but I prefer
the term Idiom.  Good engineering is fluency with many idioms.  There
is an ancient wisdom in the way things are done; it doesn't mean you
can't improve things, but if something has stuck around there is
something about it that works.  Acknowledge what works about something
before you criticize it or throw it away.

<p>Never take the flow of control away from the client.  Prefer
libraries to frameworks.  Prefer iterators to visitor patterns.

<h3>Localization of Causality</h3>

<p>The essence of debugging is localization of causality.  You can't
know what you can't see.  Therefore it is always a higher priority to
write better debugging output/infrastructure than to debug the bug.
*First* make sure the output is correct so you know what you are
looking at *then* attempt to debug the bug.  Once the causality is
clear, all bugs are obvious.

<p>Difficult bugs are long-range bugs (assuming you don't have
non-deterministic bugs); if the different parts of your code don't
know about and don't trust each other, then it is harder to get
long-range bugs.  Therefore, it is often faster to "take the time" to
write more general, reusable code as it is easier to debug.

<hr>
<h2>Software is Writing</h2>

<p>The way to design software is to write a letter to an intelligent
friend who knows nothing about your project.  When you are avoiding
working on something, just avoid it by writing a letter to yourself
about what you *would* be doing *if* you were working on it.  Write it
as a makefile rather than a script (or to-do list).  After a while the
parts get so small and simple that you say "oh, I could just *do*
that".

<p>You can tell how well factored a piece of code is by attempting to
describe in an English sentence what its purpose is.  If it is a bad
sentence that is referring to irrelevant concepts just to say what the
function does, then your code is tangled with some other code that it
shouldn't be.

<p>The code provides *content*; the comments provide *context*.
Programmers can read code, so don't repeat the code; instead state the
context that someone would need in order to understand the code.
