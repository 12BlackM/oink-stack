<h1>Oink Manifest</h1>

<p>For those who may wish to hack on Oink, I attempt here to provide
an organized top-down view of the aspects of Oink and the purpose of
each file.

<p>Many of the files and even directories you see mentioned here are
generated so you will not see them until you have build and tested
oink.

<p><b>NOTE: This is out of date, but mostly by omission</b>.  That is,
there are files not mentioned here, but the ones that are should be
documented correctly.</p>

<h3>Directory contents</h3>

<ul>

<li><a href=index.html>Oink Main Documentation</a> Introduction to
Oink.

<li><a href=oink_help.html>Annotated Oink Help Output</a> The output
of ./oink --help annotated with further details on their meaning.

<li><a href=quickstart.html>Cqual++ Quick-Start Instructions</a> The
shortest path to findings bugs in your code.

<li><a href="qual.html">Cqual++ Documentation</a> Documentation on the
main Oink tool.

<li><a href=qual_help.html>Annotated Qual Help Output</a> The output
of ./qual --help (minus the oink --help output) annotated with further
details on their meaning.

<li><a href=manifest.html>Oink Manifest [this document]</a> A top-down view of the
aspects of Oink, which files participate in each aspect, and
documentation on each file.

<li><a href=coding.html>Oink Coding Style</a> The Oink coding
guidelines; also provided is some elisp for putting emacs into the
mode I use when editing it.

<li><a href="features_of_elsa.html">Features of Elsa</a> The elsa
documentation is extensive; I simply point out a few useful features
that users of Oink/Cqual++ should know about.

</ul>

<br>Requirements for those hacking on Oink: design and syntax considerations.

<hr>
<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p><b>
configure.pl
</b>

<br>Converts its command line flags into name/value pairs with which
files named FILE.in will have '@name@' substituted by 'value' to
produce FILE.  Generates config.status which will actually do the
substitution.

<p><b>
configure
</b>

<br>Shell script for calling configure.pl.

<p><b>
config.status
</b>

<br>Actually do the substitution of names for values in files to be
configured.

<p><b>

</b>

<br>Print out the name/value pairs chosen at configuration time.

<hr>
<h2>Top level makefiles</h2>

<p><b>
Demo.mk
</b>

<br>A makefile for giving an Oink demo.

<p><b>
Makefile
Makefile.in
</b>

<br>The top level driver makefile; implements all of the features
usually provided by a makefile, such as building and testing.  It
includes (possibly indirectly) many makefiles suffixed with
'.incl.mk'.

<p><b>
Build.incl.mk
Build.incl.mk.in
</b>

<br>Included makefile for building everything.

<hr>
<h2>Testing</h2>

<p><b>
Test
</b>

<br>Directory containing tests and temporary files generated during
testing.

<p><b>
Test.incl.mk
</b>

<br>A included makefile for testing everything.

<p><b>
test_filter
</b>

<br>A script for doing a <em>controlled experiment</em> test:
generating two very similar test inputs from one annotated input such
that the difference between them is minimal and yet should make the
difference in whatever feature is being tested.

<hr>
<h2>Elsa</h2>

<p>Elsa is Scott McPeak's C++ front-end which Oink uses.  Oink builds
its own version of elsa and so its build process is subtle, as we
re-use much of elsa as-is but modify some of it slightly.  We rebuild
elsa by compiling most the elsa/*.cc files in oink, so you will notice
lots of .o and .d files in oink that do not correspond to .cc files in
oink, but instead in elsa.

<p><b>
ElsaHeaders
</b>

<br>A generated directory which contains softlinks to the header files
in Elsa that we need.  Our build process also builds our own version
of a modified elsa and we use -IElsaHeaders instead of -I../elsa on
the compile line in order to carefully exclude certain files in elsa.

<p><b>
cc.tok
</b>

<br>One of many .tok files that are the single-source of information
about the set of lexing tokens.  Many files are generated from the
collection of .tok files.

<p><b>
cc_tokens.cc
cc_tokens.h
cc_tokens.ids
</b>

<br>Files generated from the collection of .tok files for implementing
various features of language tokens.

<p><b>
cc.ast.gen.cc
cc.ast.gen.h
</b>

<br>The C++ implementation of the Elsa/Oink/Cqual++ AST which is
generated from a collection of .ast files by Scott McPeak's astgen
tool (which lives in the ../ast directory).

<p><b>
cc_type.h
cc_type.h.cpatch
</b>

<br>The base C++ type system from elsa.

<br>Note that oink/FILE.cpatch is used as a kind of diff file by
../smbase/codepatch.pl to generate oink/FILE from elsa/FILE in a
similar way to the utility 'patch'.

<p><b>
cc_print.cc
cc_print.cc.cpatch
cc_print.h
cc_print.h.cpatch
</b>

<br>A module for pretty-printing C++ AST and Types.  It is extended by
the value_print module to print abstract values and further by
qual_value_print to print qualifier annotations.

<br>Note that oink/FILE.cpatch is used as a kind of diff file by
../smbase/codepatch.pl to generate oink/FILE from elsa/FILE in a
similar way to the utility 'patch'.

<p><b>
elsa.a
</b>

<br>The version of elsa that we build, minus the main() function
module.  It isn't really necessary that we build an archive; it just
makes the build process a little cleaner.

<p><b>
    archive_srz_test.cc
elsa_tests.gen.incl.mk
elsa_tests_get
elsa_tests_omit.files
</b>

<br>Filters out the tests from elsa/regrtest that we want to use in
oink.  That is, elsa_tests_get generates elsa_tests.gen.incl.mk from
../elsa/regrtest by subtracting files in elsa_tests_omit.files.  This
mechanism is so that oink can automatically use elsa tests as they are
added to elsa unless one of them is breaking oink.  This generation
step is not done automatically anywhere; it is just for someone to run
when they feel like going through all the errors that may come up; The
resulting elsa_tests.gen.incl.mk is checked in.

<p><b>
.serialno
</b>

<br>One of the elsa debugging mechanisms is that a class may request
to have each object get a serial number by inheriting from class
SerialBase.  The generated file .serialno keeps these unique (up to
integer rollover) even across multiple calls to Elsa/Oink.  This is
handy for debugging serialized files as the state persists.

<hr>
<h2>Oink</h2>

<p>Oink provides an empty-analysis that just builds from the
infrastructure but does nothing.

<p><b>
oink_cmd.cc
oink_cmd.h
oink_cmd_util.h
</b>

<br>Processes command-line arguments for the oink empty-analysis
proper.  Other tools inherit from it and re-use the command-line flags
and their processing.

<p><b>
oink_file.cc
oink_file.h
</b>

<br>Implement handling input files for analysis.

<p><b>
oink_control.cc
oink_control.h
</b>

<br>Implement oink control files.  Examples are in Test/*.ctl

<p><b>
oink_global.cc
oink_global.h
</b>

<br>All of Oink's global variables in one place.

<p><b>
oink_util.h
</b>

<br>Some basic utilities for reporting user errors with line numbers
and other standard functionality.

<p><b>
oink_ext.tok
</b>

<p>Extensions oink makes to the token set.  This file is currently
empty as the oink empty analysis proper need make no extension to the
token set; this file exists just for completeness.

<p><b>
oink_ext.lex
</b>

<br>Extensions oink makes to the lexer.  This file is currently empty
as the oink empty analysis proper need make no extension to the lexing
rules; this file exists just for completeness.

<p><b>
oink.lex
</b>

<br>Generated lexer file for lexing the oink extensions to elsa.

<p><b>
oink_lexer.yy.cc
</b>

<br>Oink lexer generated by flex.

<p><b>
oink.gr
oink.gr.gen.cc
oink.gr.gen.h
oink.gr.gen.out
</b>

<br>oink.gr is a grammar specification file for the modifications that
oink makes to the elsa grammar.  The other files are generated from
the collection of .gr files by elkhound.

<p><b>
oink.ast
</b>

<br>An AST specification file for the modifications that oink makes to
Elsa's AST.

<p><b>
oink_ast_aux.cc
</b>

<br>Implementation of functions declared in the oink.ast file.

<p><b>
oink_type.cc
oink_type.h
oink_type_children.cc
oink_type_children.h
oink_var.cc
oink_var.h
</b>

<br>Extensions/modifications made to the oink typesystem.  Note that
oink_type.h is a strange header file that inserts a class into the
<em>middle</em> of the Elsa Type hierarchy; this simple preprocessor
trick prevents the need for multiple inheritance; do not include this
header file directly, instead include cc_type.h.  You will get a
compile-time error if you neglect to do this.
</b>

<p><b>
oink_tcheck.cc
oink_tcheck_env.cc
oink_tcheck_env.h
oink_tcheck_env_clbk.cc
oink_tcheck_env_clbk.h
</b>

<br>Extensions and modifications by oink to the typechecker; for
processing the nodes added by oink.ast.

<p><b>
oink_integrity.cc
oink_integrity.h
</b>

Check the integrity of the AST after parsing, typechecking, and
elaboration.  Not to be confused with elsa/integrity.h.

<p><b>
oink_walk.h
</b>

<br>A class AST walks may find useful to inherit from.

<p><b>
oink.h
oink.cc
</b>

<br>The primary functionality that oink proper (not including dataflow
or qual) adds to elsa.  Provides implementation of each stage of
processing, but leaves it to a main() function to call those methods.
Much here can be re-used by other analyses by inheritance.

<p><b>
oink_main.cc
</b>

<br>The main() function for the oink empty-analysis proper.

<p><b>
oink
</b>

<br>The oink executable.  Uses the infrastructure and implements the
empty analysis.  Useful for testing that Oink's modifications to elsa
haven't broken it.

<p><b>
oink_test.incl.mk
</b>

<br>Included makefile for testing the oink empty analysis proper which
exhibits the basic functionality shared among all the analysis tools.

<hr>
<h2>[Abstract] Value</h2>

<p>Any analysis that concerns itself with dataflow needs a notion of
an Abstract Value.  They are isomorphic to the "constructed" subset of
the Elsa typesystem.  These are the types that are transparent in the
sense that two are "the same type" exactly when they have the same
internal structure.  They are also the types that can take a const or
volatile qualifier.  The difference of Values from Types is two int
expressions have the same Type but different [Abstract] Values: each
Value annotates exactly one expression, whereas Types are re-used.

<p><b>
value.ast
</b>

<br>Extensions to the AST to allow for Value annotations to the AST.

<p><b>
value.h
value.cc
</b>

<br>An Abstract Value class.

<p><b>
value_ast_visitor.cc
value_ast_visitor.h
</b>

<br>An AST visitor that annotates a typechecked AST with Values.

<p><b>
value_print.cc
value_print.h
</b>

<br>A class for printing Values; inherits from elsa class TypePrinter.

<hr>
<h2>XML serialization</h2>

<p>Elsa provides XML serialization functionality (thanks to me); we
augment it here so that Oink and Qual do as well.

<p><b>
xml_ast.gen.tokens
xml_ast_reader_0decl.gen.h
xml_ast_reader_1defn.gen.cc
xml_ast_reader_2ctrc.gen.cc
xml_ast_reader_3regc.gen.cc
</b>

<br>Files generated from astgen from the collection of .ast files that
specify how to lex (.tokens file) and parse (the rest of the files)
XML.

<p><b>
xml_value.tokens
</b>

<br>Tokens used in the XML serialization language for the Value
classes.

<p><b>
xml_enum_1.gen.h
xml_lex_1.gen.lex
xml_name_1.gen.cc
</b>

<br>Files generated by the collection of .tokens files (mostly in
elsa) by ../elsa/token.pl for use in XML lexing and parsing.

<p><b>
xml_lex.gen.lex
xml_lex.gen.yy.cc
</b>

<br>Respectively the generated lex file and then the XML lexer
generated from that by flex.

<p><b>
xml_value_reader.cc
xml_value_reader.h
</b>

<br>Specialization of the ReadXml framework that reads in XML for
serialized Values.

<p><b>
xml_value_writer.cc
xml_value_writer.h
</b>

<br>Implements a simple DFS XML writer for Values.  Writing is always
easier than reading.

<p><b>
xml_canonicalize
</b>

<br>Script for canonicalizing XML output.  Implements an equivalence
relation such that an xml file should be xml_canonicalize-equivalent
to the file you get by reading it in and serializing it out again.
That is, reading then writing XML should be idempotent on the set of
XML files modulo xml_canonicalize.

<hr>
<h2>Archiving</h2>

<p>
  Classes for serializing and deserializing groups of files into an archive.

  <p><b>
    archive_srz.cc
    archive_srz.h
  </b>

  <br>Library.

  <p><b>
    archive_srz_test.cc
  </b>

  <br>Testing.

</p>

<hr>
<h2>Dataflow</h2>

<p>The primary value that Oink provides over Elsa is a whole-program
dataflow analysis.

<p><b>
dataflow_visitor.cc
dataflow_visitor.h
dataflow_cpdinit_clbk.cc
dataflow_cpdinit_clbk.h
</b>

<br>An AST Visitor that computes a instance-sensitive, polymorphic,
non-flow-sensitive, non-path-sensitive, expression granularity
dataflow graph on a Translation Unit AST.  When a pair of expressions
is found between which data flows, the pair is handed off to the
dataflow_ex module below.

<p><b>
dataflow_ex.cc
dataflow_ex.h
</b>

<br>Insert a single expression-level edge by driving a call with the
appropriate arguments on the underlying class DataFlowTy in the
dataflow_ty module below.

<p><b>
dataflow_ty.cc
dataflow_ty.h
</b>

<br>Given two top-level Value trees between which data should flow,
makes the dataflow calls between individual [Abstract] Value nodes.

<hr>
<h2>Lib: utility library</h2>

<p>A library for utilities, such as useful non-standard container
classes.

<p><b>
Lib/union_find.h
</b>

<br>Hashable-based implementation of the union find algorithm.

<p><b>
Lib/union_find_map.h
</b>

<br>A data-structure I have never had a need for before nor have I ever
seen in any book or container library:<ul>
<li>a map from one set of objects to another, and
<li>a equivalence relation (implemented as a union-find) on the domain
of the map.
</ul>
The invariant is that the map is well-defined when the domain is
modded out by the equivalence-relation.  That is, the pull-back of
anything in the range of the map is always in the same equivalence
class in the relation.

<p><b>
Lib/union_find_test
Lib/union_find_test.cc
Lib/LibTest.incl.mk
</b>

<br>Code and makefile for testing union_find.  The union_find_map
module is only tested by its usage in oink.

<hr>
<h2>LibCpdInit: compound initializers library</h2>

<p>AST-agnostic and Typesystem-agnostic library for computing the
dataflow resulting from a C99 compound initializers expression.  Does
not work in C++ nor in instance-sensitive mode unfortunately.  Has been
tested versus the CIL implementation by George Necula.  If you are
writing some other C++ front-end, this module is designed to be
re-usable in it, which is why it is a separate directory.

<p><b>
LibCpdInit/Readme
</b>

<br>Readme just for LibCpdInit.

<p><b>
LibCpdInit/configure
</b>

<br>A script that announces there is no configuration to be done.

<p><b>
LibCpdInit/Makefile
</b>

<br>For testing purposes, build a vacuous LibCpdInit against its own
cpdinit_lib.h which specifies what the compiler writer would have to
provide.

<p><b>
LibCpdInit/Grammar
</b>

<br>Documentation in the syntax of an elkhound grammar for the subset
of the AST that LibCpdInit knows about; again, this is just
documentation.  Note that LibCpdInit will work with any grammar if you
provide the right interface.

<p><b>
LibCpdInit/cpdinit.cc
LibCpdInit/cpdinit.h
</b>

<br>Process one Value/compound-initializer pair, generating dataflow edges.

<p><b>
LibCpdInit/member_type_iter.cc
LibCpdInit/member_type_iter.h
</b>

<br>An iterator used by the cpdinit module to keep track of where it
is in the compound initializer.

<p><b>
LibCpdInit/cpdinit_lib.h
</b>

<br>A vacuous header file that shows what needs to be provided by a
compiler writer to use LibCpdInit.  Using the Makefile, LibCpdInit
will build against this header file.

<hr>
<h2>Compound initializers testing</h2>

<p><b>
cpdinit_headers.h
</b>

<br>The Oink headers that LibCpdInit needs to build.

<p><b>

<hr>
<h2>Staticprint</h2>

<p>Static Printer: A sample Oink tool that shows how to query the AST
and typesystem; for now it just prints the inheritance graph.  If
there is something you always wanted a tool to tell you about your raw
program, implement it as feature here and send it to me.

<hr>
<h2>Qual</h2>

<p>Qualifier analysis: The flagship Oink tool that hooks Scott
McPeak's C++ front-end elsa, the oink dataflow functionality, and Rob
Johnson's libqual backend together into a polymorphic qualifier
analysis for C and C++.

<p><b>
qual_cmd.cc
qual_cmd.h
</b>

<br>Process command-line arguments.

<p><b>
qual_global.cc
qual_global.h
</b>

<br>All globals in one place.

<p><b>
qual_ext.tok
</b>

<br>Qual extensions to the lexing tokens.

<p><b>

</b>

<br>Qual extensions to the lexer.

<p><b>
qual.lex
</b>

<br>Generated lexer file for lexing the qual extensions to elsa.

<p><b>
qual_lexer.yy.cc
</b>

<br>Qual lexer generated by flex.

<p><b>
qual.gr
qual.gr.gen.cc
qual.gr.gen.h
qual.gr.gen.out
</b>

<br>qual.gr is a grammar specification file for the modifications that
qual makes to the elsa grammar (beyond those of oink).  The other
files are generated from the collection of .gr files by elkhound.

<p><b>
qual.ast
</b>

<br>An AST specification file for the modifications that qual makes to
Elsa's AST (beyond those of oink).

<p><b>
qual_ast_aux.cc
qual_ast_aux.h
</b>

<br>Implementation of functions declared in the qual.ast file.

<p><b>
qual_literal.cc
qual_literal.h
</b>

<br>Implements 1) representing the syntax and 2) providing the
semantics of qualifier literals such as $tainted.

<p><b>
qual_funky.cc
qual_funky.h
</b>

<br>The word "polymorphic" is seriously overloaded in the world of
programming languages.  Implementation of the polymorphic ("funky")
qualifier literals syntax, such as this.
<pre>
   char $_1 * strchr(const char $_1 * s, int c);
</pre>

<p><b>
qual_value_children.cc
qual_value_children.h
</b>

<br>Qual versions of the Value classes, such as this.
<pre>
   class CVAtomicValue_Q : public CVAtomicValue
</pre>

<p><b>
qual_var.cc
</b>

<br>Qual extensions to the oink variable system.  These functions
would go on a "qual annot variable" class except that there is no
extra state so no such extra class is necessary.

<p><b>
qual_annot.cc
qual_annot.h
</b>

<br>Annotations onto the *Value_Q types that hold the libqual backend
annotations.  The idea is to keep the libqual backend implementation
of the oink/qual_* modules somewhat separated from oink/qual_* itself.

<p><b>
qual_dataflow_visitor.cc
qual_dataflow_visitor.h
qual_dataflow_ex.cc
qual_dataflow_ex.h
qual_dataflow_ty.cc
qual_dataflow_ty.h
</b>

<br>Qual subclasses of the respective dataflow modules; these classes
inherit from the generic dataflow and modify its behavior for purposes
of the qual analysis.

<p><b>
qual_value_print.cc
qual_value_print.h
</b>

<br>Modifications to the Type/Value pretty-printing process to
implement the -fq-print-trans-qual functionality.  A 'type printer'
for oink [Abstract] Values that will also print the conclusions of the
backend as to the qualifiers that apply at each point.

<p><b>
qual_xml_value_reader.cc/.h
qual_xml_value_writer.cc/.h
</b>

<br>Subclasses of xml_value_reader.h and xml_value_writer.h
respectively that serialize the *Value_Q and Variable_Q classes
instead of their Oink versions.  These qual classes do not actually
have additional data, so the serialization just renames the tags and
re-uses the oink serialization.

<p><b>
qual_libqual_iface.cc
qual_libqual_iface.h
</b>

<br>An interface to the libqual polymorphic qualifier backend.

<p><b>
qual.cc
qual.h
</b>

<br>The primary functionality that qual adds to oink.  Provides
implementation of each stage of processing, but leaves it to a main()
function to call those methods.

<p><b>
qual_main.cc
</b>

<br>Just the main() function for the qual analysis proper.

<p><b>
qual
</b>

<br>The qual executable.

<p><b>
qual_taintXcasts.lattice
</b>

<br>Qual lattice file that implements a $tainted analysis that
survives through casts.

quals.dot
</b>

<br>File generated by the -fq-print-quals-graph flag by the libqual backend.

<p><b>
qual_graph_component
</b>

<br>Filter the quals.dot output of the backend so that the resulting
graph consists only of the connected component containing a single
given root node.

<p><b>
qual_parse_test.incl.mk
qual_result_test.incl.mk
qual_serialization_test.incl.mk
qual_test.incl.mk
</b>

<br>Included makefiles for testing the qual tool.
