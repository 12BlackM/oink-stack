<h1>Cqual++ Quick-Start</h1>

<p><a href=index.html>Oink Main Documentation</a>

<p>On this page we show you how to use Oink/Cqual++ to find <a
href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Format_string_vulnerabilities>printf
format string bugs</a> in <u>your</u> code as soon as possible.  You
can do other things with Oink as well, but we want to show you the
end-to-end process of doing one useful thing right away.  Some of this
information is redundant with that of the <a href=index.html>main Oink
page</a>; I repeat it so these instructions would be self-contained.
You need to do the following.<ul>

<li><a href="#get_oink">Get Oink</a>.

<li><a href="#config_build">Configure and build Oink</a>.

<li><a href="#intercept">Intercept the preprocessed files</a> (.i
files) from your own project.

<li><a href="#run">Run Cqual++</a>.

<li><a

'em and weep</a>.

</ul>

<a name=get_oink>
<h2>Get Oink</h2>
</a>

<p>You can get the latest <a
href="http://www.cubewano.org/oink/releases/">tarball release</a>.
However I suggest instead that you get oink directly from the
subversion repository; everything you need is actually in one single
container repository called <tt>oink-stack</tt>.  You will need an
ssl-enabled <a href=http://subversion.tigris.org>subversion</a>
client.  NOTE: We have a report that TortoiseSVN is not working; use
the command-line svn utility.

<blockquote>
   <tt>svn checkout https://svn.cubewano.org/repos/oink-stack/trunk oink-stack</tt>
</blockquote>

<a name=config_build>
<h2>Configure and Build Oink</h2>
</a>

<p>To build everything, in <tt>oink-stack/</tt> type:

<blockquote><tt>
  ./configure && make clean all check
</tt></blockquote>

<p>Upon successful build, you should see

<blockquote><tt>
  ================================================================<br/>
  DONE in all directories: check<br/>
  ================================================================<br/>
</tt></blockquote>

<p>If you have problems with the platform-model tests failing with a
segmentation fault, this seems to often be due to problems with
libzipios++ and zlib.  Make sure that your version of these libraries
was built with the same version of the compiler that you are building
Oink with.  Another solution is to just turn off zip archiving,
falling back to a more primitive method.  Do this from the oink-stack
directory as follows.

<blockquote><tt>
  ./configure +platform-model:--archive-srz=dir +oink:-require-no-archive-srz-zip
</tt></blockquote>

<a name=intercept>
<h2>Intercept your .i files</h2>
</a>

<p>Oink works on files that have been through the preprocessor,
usually known as .i files.  You have to get these files from the build
process of your project somehow.  If your project has a simple build
process and uses gcc, you can do this by just adding
<tt>-save-temps</tt> to the compile flags, which we will use here.
For industrial-strength build process interception of any build
process using gcc you may want to use <a
href=http://build-interceptor.tigris.org/>build-interceptor</a>.

<p>For demonstration purposes I have written a really simple example
project in oink-stack/oink/Test/Quickstart1/.  All of the changes to
the makefile needed to produce the .i files amount to these as
follows.

<pre>
    TOCLEAN += *.i *.s
    CFLAGS += -save-temps
</pre>

<p>Here it the build process in action.

<pre>
    cd /home/dsw/oink-stack/oink/Test/Quickstart1/
    make clean all check
    rm -f  *.i *.s *.o hello
    cc -save-temps -c -o main.o main.c
    cc -save-temps -c -o g.o g.c
    cc -o hello main.o g.o
    Testing.
    HELLO='good data' ./hello
    Hello, World!  The important data is good data
    HELLO='evil data' ./hello
    Hello, World!  The important data is evil data
</pre>

<a name=run>
<h2>Run Cqual++</h2>
</a>

<p>We now want to run Oink/Cqual++, <tt>oink-stack/oink/qual</tt>, on
the .i files.  In general, to learn more about what Oink/Cqual++ it
can do, see <a href=qual.html>the Cqual++ documentation</a>; for more
on its command line flags, type <tt>oink-stack/oink/qual --help</tt>.

<p>To illustrate how to get started, I have added to the
<tt>oink-stack/oink/Test/Quickstart1/Makefile</tt> a section just to
do this for you.

<pre>
    OINK_STACK := ../../..
    .PHONY: analyze
    analyze: all
            $(OINK_STACK)/oink-scripts/bin/qualx main.i g.i -lc
</pre>

<p>Here it is in action.  Note that the total time includes loading
the libc dataflow model, so Cqual++ will seem rather slow for
analyzing such a tiny program; I talk about this below.

<pre>
    cd /home/dsw/oink-stack/oink/Test/Quickstart1/
    make analyze
    ../../../oink-scripts/bin/qualx main.i g.i -lc
    Reporting 4 of 4 errors (including anonymous)

        . . . (skipping duplicate errors) . . .

    main.i:1823 WARNING (4 of 4):  ( (getenv) ( ("HELLO")))' treated as $tainted and $untainted

     ( (getenv) ( ("HELLO")))': $tainted $untainted 
    /home/dsw/oink-stack/platform-model/libc_glibc-2.3.5/src/stdlib.qual.i:2178:15: $tainted <=  t149145-char
    main.i:1631:13: <= getenv_ret'
    main.i:1823:3: <=  ( (getenv) ( ("HELLO")))'
    main.i:1823:3: <= data''
    main.i:1824:3: <=  t5117-char
    main.i:1815:6: <=  t5117-char
    main.i:1815:6: <= data''
    main.i:1817:5: <=  t1628-char
    main.i:10:6: <=  t6740-char
    g.i:918:6: <=  t8488-char
    g.i:918:6: <= data''
    g.i:920:3: <=  const t7909-char
    g.i:644:12: <=  const t85944-char
    /home/dsw/oink-stack/platform-model/libc_glibc-2.3.5/src/stdio.qual.i:1990:5: <= $untainted

    make: *** [analyze] Error 32
</pre>

<p>As you can see, Cqual++ is showing you a dataflow path from
<tt>$tainted</tt> to <tt>$untainted</tt>; note that the output format
is designed so that in emacs compile mode, C-x backtick should take
you from one line to the next.  Since <tt>$tainted</tt> does indeed
flow to <tt>$untainted</tt>, Cqual++ returns error code 32, rather
than 0.

<h3>Presentation bugs</h3>

<p>Please note that we do not normally use Cqual++ manually in the way
I am illustrating (we use it wrapped with other tools etc) so in
preparing this Quick-Start a few bugs have been revealed to us.<ul>

<li>There is a long standing bug that the "same" error is often
reported more than once.  This is harder to fix that it may at first
appear: the backend finds many "bad" dataflow paths and it could just
report them all, but instead it uses heuristics to try to report the
ones you are most likely to be interested in; in this example the
heuristics are not managing to reduce all of them down to one.

<li>Per the previous point, in the output above, I have removed all
but the last error report in order to eliminate redundancy.  If you
actually run this example and look at all of the output you will
notice another bug: some of the error reports do not properly print
the names of the variables or expressions in the path.

<li>We give source locations in the .i files instead of mapping them
back to the .c files.  We can map the locations back to the .c files,
but doing that is, right now, strangely triggering another bug.

</ul>

<h3>Going further</h3>

<p>You may ask yourself "wow, this is awfully slow just to analyze
such a tiny program".  The problem is that we are linking against Karl
Chen's entire dataflow model for libc (note the flag -lc), which is
really large.  If you would like to avoid that delay you can write
your own annotations just for the headers that you use and include
only them.  Doing this makes it much faster to run experiments: on a
small program that doesn't load the libc dataflow model Cqual++
finishes immediately.  The following examples are self-contained like
this.<ul>

<li><a href=qual.html#jeffs_example>Jeff Foster's Canonical Cqual
Example</a> for the original and best example :-).

<li>For a <a href=qual.html#horrible_example>more dramatic demo</a> on
C++, see the horrible target in the makefile oink/Demo.mk.

</ul>

Documentation</a>.
