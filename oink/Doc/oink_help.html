<h3>Help output</h3>

<p>The actual output is in fixed-width bold and commentary on it
follows.  Note that the defaults can be found in oink/oink_cmd.cc;
look for the constructor which starts OinkCmd::OinkCmd(); flag names
have their '-o-' or '-fo-' prefix removed and have their dashes
replace with underscores.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
All arguments not starting with a '-' are considered to be input files.

oink flags that take an argument:
</font></b></pre>

<p>Some Oink flags take arguments.  These start with '-o-' to indicate
that they are flags that can be implemented directly by Oink.  The
organization of Oink is that other tools such as Cqual++ "inherit"
from the Oink command line processing.  All '-o-' arguments (and
'-fo-' flags; see below) are implemented by the core Oink system and
have the same semantics.  Other tools in Oink are encouraged to have
their own letter distinct from 'o' and each other so that their flags
can follow the same nomenclature and be distinct; for example, the
letter for qual is 'q'.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-o-lang LANG             : specify the input language; one of:
      KandR_C, ANSI_C89, ANSI_C99, GNU_C, GNU_KandR_C, GNU2_KandR_C,
      ANSI_Cplusplus, GNU_Cplusplus, SUFFIX.
</font></b></pre>

<p>Despite the existence of specifications, there are many versions of
both C and C++.  In Elsa, we created a combination of configuration
variables that spans the space of the various combinations of features
that the various versions of C and C++ correspond to; these are
declared in elsa/cc_lang.h.  Here are some examples; the comments
serve to document their semantics.

<pre>
  // when true, we allow overloaded function declarations (same name,
  // different signature)
  bool allowOverloading;

  // when true, to every compound type add the name of the type itself
  bool compoundSelfName;

  // when true, allow a function call to a function that has never
  // been declared, implicitly declaring the function in the global
  // scope; this is for C89 (and earlier) support
  Bool3 allowImplicitFunctionDecls;

  // when true, allow function definitions that omit any return type
  // to implicitly return 'int'.
  bool allowImplicitInt;
</pre>

<p>What most people think of as a version of C or C++ corresponds to
setting these variables to a vector of configuration values.  The
conversion from a language setting to the proper vector of conversion
values is a kind of "change of basis" matrix; it is implemented in
elsa/cc_lang.cc.

<p>The name of the language setting corresponds directly to a
function call in elsa/cc_lang.cc, except for SUFFIX.  The SUFFIX
setting is the default and chooses a C++ language setting if the
filename ends in an ending that gcc considers to be a C++ ending and C
otherwise; it is implemented in oink/oink_cmd.cc:getLangFromSuffix().

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-o-program-files FILE    : add *contents* of FILE to list of input files
</font></b></pre>

<p>Sometimes you may have so many files to analyze that they will
exceed the allowed command-line length for a program on your operating
system.  You can put the names of the files into a text file, one per
line, and then just give that file as the argument to this flag.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-o-control FILE          : give a file for controlling the behavior of oink
</font></b></pre>

<p>Sometimes the configuration of the behavior of oink exceeds what is
natural on the command line and begins to approach that of a
configuration or command language.  Control files are the answer to
various kinds of behaviors we want to control within oink; they are
implemented in oink/oink_control.{h,cc}.

<p>Generally the consist of a constructor call with various arguments.
Here are some examples.

<pre>
weak-def:
    file = Test/unsat_symbol3b.c
    name = foo

ignore-body-qual:
    file = Test/unsat_symbol5c.cc
    name = A::foo
</pre>

<p>See oink/Test/simple1.ctl for a general example of the limits of
the syntax. <ul>

<li>ignore-body and ignore-body-qual mean to ignore the body of the
function they name during dataflow analysis.

<li>weak-def has something to do with weak definitions that I can't
figure out right now; Karl added this.

<li>unsound-if-used means to warn if this variable is used in the
dataflow.

</ul>

<p>Generally, see the enum
oink/oink_control.h:OinkControl::ControlKind for comments describing
their behavior.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-o-func-filter FILE      : give a file listing Variables to be filtered out
</font></b></pre>

<p>When doing a whole-program analysis you can exceed the memory of
your machine, even the virtual memory.  Some analyses, such as
Cqual++, have a feature for partial compilation very much like a real
compiler: you 1) first analyze or "compile" each translation unit and
serialize the results in some form and then 2) combine or "link" these
together to get a whole program analysis.  This helps, but even though
the linking stage can have far less input to deal with than if you
"compiled" everything at once, it can still exceed your memory.

<p>To try to help in such situations we have a feature that can be
thought of as a control-flow (which subsumes dataflow) analysis at the
global variable / function granularity.  We create a graph where the
nodes are whole functions or global variables and each function
contains a "body", the edges of the graph, which is just a list of the
other functions or globals that the function can reach.  Such a graph
can be generated easily per translation unit and then "linked"
together without any chance of exceeding your memory; linking consists
of finding what nodes are reachable from the main() function and any
global variables (note that in C++ these can have constructors and
destructors).

<p>The resulting whole-program function-granularity control-flow graph
can then be used as a configuration file when doing the analysis "for
real".  That is, this file can be passed as input to the "compilation"
stage of each translation unit; any function not named in the file
will have its body skipped, since it could not be reached in a real
run of the program anyway.

<p>To generate the function-granularity control-flow graph per
translation unit, use the <b>-fo-func-gran</b> flag (below); this
generates a graph in a format similar to make.  To link these graphs
together, use the simple <b>oink/digraph_component</b> perl script; it
just does a DFS.  To then pass the resulting function-granularity
reachability set to the real analysis as it compiles and links, use
<b>-o-func-filter FILE</b>.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-o-srz FILE              : serialize to FILE
</font></b></pre>

<p>This flag is overloaded for different situations.<ul>

<li>When provided on its own, it means to serialize the Types and
AbstractValues of the input file.  This is not terribly useful other
than for testing the linker.

<li>When passed to the client Cqual++, it means to serialize further
state along with the Types and AbstractValues such as the dataflow
graph between them.

<li>When <b>-fo-func-gran</b> is passed (see above) it means to
serialize the function-granularity dataflow graph to FILE.

</ul>

<pre><b><font size=+1>
oink boolean flags; precede by '-fo-no-' for the negative sense.
</font></b></pre>

<p>Some Oink flags do not take arguments.  These start with '-fo-',
which means "flag, oink"; see the discussion above on keeping flag
namespaces separate.  Note that often these flags are in fact on by
default and they are useful in their negative form of '-fo-no-'.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-help, -help, --help  : print this message and exit
</font></b></pre>

<p>In other tools that extend Oink, <b>--help</b> will print their
help message after the Oink one.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-verbose              : print the setting of each flag
</font></b></pre>

<p>Will also print strings corresponding to some configure-time
switches if it was natural for me to do that.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-print-stages         : announce each processing stage
</font></b></pre>

<p>There are many stages in the processing of an input file.  If
several files are provided all files advance through each of the
stages together.  If this flag is on, as each new stage is entered,
the sage is announced with a print statement.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-exit-after-parse     : exit after parsing
</font></b></pre>

<p>Exit immediately after parsing is done and <b>-fo-print-ast</b> has
had a chance to run; using these two flags together will give you a
printout of the ambiguous AST before it has been typechecked and
disambiguated.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-exit-after-typecheck : exit after typechecking
</font></b></pre>

<p>Exit immediately after parsing is done and
<b>-fo-print-typed-ast</b> has had a chance to run; using these two
flags together will give you a printout of the un-ambiguous AST after
it has been typechecked and disambiguated.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-exit-after-elaborate : exit after elaborating
</font></b></pre>

<p>Exit immediately after parsing is done and
<b>-fo-print-elaborated-ast</b> has had a chance to run; using these
two flags together will give you a printout of the un-ambiguous AST
after it has been typechecked, disambiguated, and elaborated.  For
more on elaboration, see the discussion at <b>-fo-do-elaboration</b>
below.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-print-startstop      : delimit transformed output with cut lines
</font></b></pre>

<p>If you are both using a flag that results in output per each input
file, such as -fo-print-typed-ast, and also you are providing more
than one input file, then using this flag will print delimiter lines
before and after the output.  The script elsa/chop_out can then be
used to easily separate them.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-func-gran            : compute and print function granularity CFG only
                              (use -o-srz to write to file)
</font></b></pre>

<p>See the discussion at <b>-o-func-filter FILE</b> above.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-func-gran-dot        : print function granularity CFG in dot format
</font></b></pre>

<p>This renders out the function granularity graph but in a form that
when given to the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">'dot'</a> program
will produce a human-readable post-script file of the graph.  This is
only useful on small examples or the graph is simply unreadable.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-all-pass-filter      : assert that all variables pass the filter
</font></b></pre>

<p>This flag asserts that the filter provided does not filter out
anything.  Since filtering should be idempotent, if you filter once,
serialize, and then filter again, the second time the filter should
filter out nothing; to ensure that, this flag can be set.  See the
discussion at <b>-o-func-filter FILE</b> above.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-print-ast            : print the ast
</font></b></pre>

<p>Print the ambiguous AST after parsing.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-print-typed-ast      : print the ast after typechecking
</font></b></pre>

<p>Print the un-ambiguous AST after typechecking.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-print-elaborated-ast : print the ast after elaboration
</font></b></pre>

<p>Print the un-ambiguous AST after elaboration.  For more on
elaboration, see the discussion at <b>-fo-do-elaboration</b> below.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-print-ML-types       : print types in ML-style; AST print, not pretty-pr
</font></b></pre>

<p>Under some circumstances that I forget prints out the types in a
form that is more top-down in a style that more readily lends itself
to annotation.  We call this an "ML-style" as perhaps it resembles the
way types are printed in ML, but it is by no means an accurate
duplicate of the syntax of C++ types as if they were ML types.  I made
this up for some thing I needed and I don't remember what it was.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-print-buckets        : print buckets
</font></b></pre>

<p>When <b>-fo-instance-sensitive</b> is on (see below), a refinement
of the dataflow is implemented that lowers false positives.  This flag
prints the internals for debugging purposes.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-print-stats          : print analysis stats
</font></b></pre>

<p>Prints a few lines of basic stats on the number of Variables and Values created.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-print-sizes          : print internal data structure sizes and exit
</font></b></pre>

<p>Prints a few lines on the sizes of the objects in memory for
various common objects that we allocate.  For memory usage debugging.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-print-proc-stats     : print process stats
</font></b></pre>

<p>Print out /proc/self/status.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-pretty-print         : print the ast as source
</font></b></pre>

<p>Print the source back out in a way that approximates as closely as
possible a syntax that would parse and typecheck back to the program
that we have.  Note that the Elsa lexer and parser loose a lot of
information; so the pretty printer effectively canonicalizes your
file.  Probably in many places there are more parentheses than needed.
Unsurprisingly it works better for C than C++, but works better for
both than I thought it ever would.

<p>Pretty printing is intended to be usable for implementing
source-to-source translation: that is, you should be able to write a
tool that uses the Elsa front-end to parse, typecheck, and elaborate a
program, modify its AST, and then pretty print it back out to get a
modified form that should compile.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-trace-link           : trace linking
</font></b></pre>

<p>Prints debugging information as linking is done.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-report-link-errors   : print un-satisfied/over-satisfied function symbols in linker
</font></b></pre>

<p>Just as a real linker would report an error if there were too many
or two few definitions for a symbol, when this flag is set we do the
same.  If you are using the linker, you should be using this flag.
Not sure why I have it off by default!

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-report-unused-controls  : print controls that go unused
</font></b></pre>

<p>It is easy to write a control in a control file that "misses its
target"; that is, that tries to specify a function but gets the name
mangling or something wrong and the control will go unused.  Also
usually when you write such a file you expect that each one of your
controls will in fact be unused.  By setting this flag you will get an
error if a control is unused.  See the discussion at <b>-o-control
FILE</b> above.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-print-controls-and-exit : print the controls and stop
</font></b></pre>

<p>Just print out the controls after reading them in; used for
debugging control files.  See the discussion at <b>-o-control FILE</b>
above.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-do-overload          : do overload res., overriding language default
</font></b></pre>

<p>This is passed to Elsa: do in fact do overload resolution.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-do-op-overload       : do op overload res., overriding language default
</font></b></pre>

<p>This is passed to Elsa: do in fact do operator overload resolution.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-do-elaboration       : do elaboration (for C++)
</font></b></pre>

<p>This is passed to Elsa: do in fact do elaboration.  See the
comments in elsa/cc_elaborate.h for more elaborate (ha!)
documentation.  Here is Scott's overview.

<pre>
// The concept of semantic elaboration is that we provide, for many
// constructs in the language, equivalent alternative formulations in
// terms of a smaller set of primitive operations.  Then, an analysis
// can use the elaboration instead of building into itself the language
// spec's specified semantics.
</pre>

<p>Here are some examples.

<pre>
  // This replaces return-by-value for class-valued objects with
  // call-by-reference:
  //   - At every call site that would return by value, a temporary
  //     is created, and passed to the function as an additional
  //     argument.  Here, "passed" means the E_funCall or E_constructor
  //     has a 'retObj' pointer to the expression denoting the temporary.
  //   - In the callee, a special "<retVar>" variable is created; it is
  //     implicit that it gets its value from the passed temporary.  All
  //     S_returns are then rewritten to return nothing, but instead
  //     construct the <retVar> in their 'ctorStatement'.
  EA_ELIM_RETURN_BY_VALUE  = 0x0001,

  // At the end of a destructor, create a 'dtorStatement' which is the
  // sequence of dtors of superclasses and members.
  EA_MEMBER_DTOR           = 0x0002,

  // At member initializers (MemberInits), create a 'ctorStatement'
  // which explicates the construction of the superclass subobject or
  // class member as an E_constructor call.
  EA_MEMBER_CTOR           = 0x0004,

  // In constructors, for any superclasses or members that are not
  // explicitly initialized, insert MemberInits that invoke the
  // default (no-arg) constructor for the superclass or member.
  EA_IMPLICIT_MEMBER_CTORS = 0x0008,
</pre>

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-check-AST-integrity  : check the AST is a tree
</font></b></pre>

<p>Check various integrity conditions I think should be true on the
tree.  Elsa has its own version of integrity checking that is
unrelated.  Here is the documentation at the top of
oink/oink_integrity.h.

<pre>
// Check the integrity of the AST after parsing, typechecking, and
// elaboration.  Not to be confused with elsa/integrity.h.

// We check the following:
//
// 1) The map *to* AST nodes is 1-1.
//
// 2) If requested, the map *to* Values (from AST nodes, variables,
// and other types) is 1-1.
//
// 3) Various other ad-hoc things don't occur anywhere.  One such is
// that Declarator::context is not DC_UNKNOWN
</pre>

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-merge-E_variable-and-var-values :
        optimization: merge Values for E_variable expressions and Variables
</font></b></pre>

<p>This flag causes an optimization to be done where the
AbstractValues of Variables and any E_variable expressions that refer
to them are combined into one.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-instance-sensitive   : C mode only.
                           1) fields get unique values per struct instance
                           2) 'void's get unique values by type
</font></b></pre>

<p>When this flag is on each syntactic instance of the same struct
type gets its own representative; the alternative (and the default) is
that a struct would be treated rather like a namespace and all
instances of a given field simply conflated.  When two structs of the
same type meet, they are merged completely, so this refinement of the
dataflow only works for groups of the same struct that never meet
statically.  Rob Johnson says that this is an important refinement for
processing the Linux kernel.

<p>A similar optimization is done for the various possible values that
can flow into a 'void' (usually when it is part of a 'void*'): that
is, if you flow an int* and a struct A* into a void* and flow them
back out to an int* and struct A* later, they do not "mix" inside the
void*.

<p>The whole system is implemented lazily for maximum efficiency.
That is, when instance-sensitivity is on, each copy of a struct gets a
"bucket" into which any members are thrown.  However, these members
are not created unless they are needed.  When two buckets meet, the
members that are in both are unified (in the dataflow graph sense of
the word), members that are only in one are shared, and the two
buckets themselves are merged.  This is all rather complex and prone
to error and can be hard to debug.  If you dare to see all of this
complexity in its full horror and glory, turn on the
<b>-fo-print-buckets</b> flag.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fo-array-index-flows    : the array index flows through the array deref
</font></b></pre>

<p>Normally the index of an array de-reference is not considered to
"flow" to the expression that is the resulting value of the
de-reference.  That is in this expression "x = a[i]" where "a" is an
array and "i" an int, the "i" does not flow to "a[i]" and consequently
does not flow to "x".  This is often the semantics that you want.

<p>However, consider the case where "a" is an array of chars that maps
them to their upper-case version, say "to_upper".  In this case, the
map preserves almost all information and we might well want to
consider the data as flowing from the index to the value of the
de-reference expression.  Currently this flag turns the flow on or off
for the whole program but we are thinking about some way to refine
this, perhaps with a control file.  If you can think of a good way,
let us know.
