<h2>Introduction</h2>
</a>

<p>Welcome to Oink! Oink is a collaboration of C++ static analysis
tools.  The C/C++ front-end for Oink is <a
href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smcpeak/elkhound/sources/elsa/">Elsa</a>
by <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smcpeak/">Scott McPeak</a>.
Currently the main tool provided by Oink is Cqual++, a polymorphic
whole-program dataflow analysis for C++.  Cqual++ was inspired by <a
href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jfoster/">Jeff Foster's</a> and <a
href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jfoster/cqual/">Cqual</a> tool and shares
the backend solver with it.
</p>

<p>Oink aims to be<ol>

<li><em>industrial-strength</em> for immediate utility in finding bugs,

<li><em>extensible</em> for ease in adding backends, and

<li><em>composable</em> for ease in combining existing backends.

</ol>

<p>Oink computes both <ol>

<li>expression-level and type-level dataflow, and

<li>statement-level intra-procedural controlflow [by delegating to Elsa].

</ol>

<p>It easy to get started by using the two demo backends that print
graphs of these flows.  Oink also comes with a client of the dataflow
analysis that does type qualifier inference: Cqual++, a C/C++ frontend
for <a href=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jfoster/cqual>Cqual</a>.
Whole-program analyses may be attempted using the linker imitator.


<h3>History and previous work</h3>

<p>The primary tool in Oink is Cqual++.  <a
href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jfoster/cqual/">Cqual</a> was the
original tool that lead to the development of Oink/Cqual++.  Cqual++
is not really a fork or a second version of Cqual as everything was
completely re-written; however the design was informed by the close
connection with the Cqual developers and we appreciate their
co-operation.

<p>The oink front-end, <a
href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smcpeak/elkhound/sources/elsa/">
elsa</a>, is completely original work by <a
href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smcpeak/">Scott McPeak</a>, whereas
the Cqual front-end was a version of gcc 2.8.1 hacked by <a
href="http://berkeley.intel-research.net/dgay/"> David Gay</a>.  The
qualifier dataflow backend, libqual, is a polymorphic
re-implementation by <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~rtjohnso/">Rob
Johnson</a> of <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jfoster/">Jeff
Foster</a> monomorphic backend.  The oink dataflow analysis was
written by <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~dsw/"> Daniel
S. Wilkerson</a> and is separate from the libqual backend so that it
can be re-used.  Only David Gay's libregion library was re-used as-is.
Significant testing, bug fixes, and optimizations and generalizations
were made by <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~quarl/"> Karl
Chen</a> starting late February 2006 making Oink much more industrial
strength.

<p>The original work on Cqual was supported by <a
href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/">Alex Aiken</a>.  The work on
Oink and Cqual++ was supported by Alex Aiken and <a
href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/">David Wagner</a>.  Without
their ongoing support the project would not have happened.

<p>The following articles used the Oink infrastructure.  There is no
Oink article to cite (yet?), which is why you may not see a citation
for it.  If you use Oink and want to cite it, please cite this URL: <a

<h3>Companion projects</h3>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://delta.tigris.org/">Delta</a> assists you in
minimizing "interesting" files subject to a test of their
interestingness. A common such situation is when attempting to isolate
a small failure-inducing substring of a large input that causes your
program to exhibit a bug.

<li><a href="http://build-interceptor.tigris.org/">Build Interceptor</a>
captures the .i files of any project while it is built from source
using the gcc tool-chain.

<li><b>Compound Init</b> is a small package for implementing the
semantics of Compound Initializer syntax as described in the C99
standard, section 6.7.8, including Designated Initializers and the gcc
Range Initializer extension to the syntax.  That is, Compound Init
maps from 1) a type tree and 2) a compound initializer abstract syntax
tree to a sequence of pairs of leaf types and leaf initializers.
Compound Init is designed for maximum ease of inclusion into an
existing compiler.  It was a separate project, but is now just the
LibCpdInit subdirectory of oink.

<h2>The Oink-Stack subversion repository</h2>
</a>

<p>You need an entire collection of repositories in order to build
oink.  In order to facilitate operating on them as one unit, there is
a "container" subversion repository called "oink-stack".  Oink-stack
is empty of content other than a meta-configure script and a
meta-makefile.  Using a feature of subversion where one repository
may "soft-link" to others with the 'svn:externals' property it
includes all of the repositories below, which is the minimum
collection of software necessary to build and run Oink. </p>

<ul>

<li><b><a

<p>More generally, the Oink-Stack repository is what we call a
"software stack": it is a collection of repositories that together
form one large project of composable parts.  The name is reminiscent
of the TCP/IP networking stack, which we think of as being organized
this way. </p>

<h3>Getting the code</h3>

To check out oink-stack, install git, then go to the oink-stack github
page and follow instructions: <a
href=http://github.com/dsw/oink-stack/tree/master>http://github.com/dsw/oink-stack/tree/master</a>

<p>Note that oink-stack contains all of the component
repositories.</p>

<p>There was a very old version of oink called
oink_all-2004.11.19.tar.gz; it is now retired.  If you have a copy,
please delete it.  If your friends have a copy, break into their
computer and delete that.


<h3>Building</h3>

<p>See above for dependencies.  To build everything, in <tt>oink-stack/</tt> type:

<blockquote><tt>
  ./configure && make clean all check
</tt></blockquote>

<p>Upon successful build, you should see

<blockquote><tt>
  ================================================================<br/>
  DONE in all directories: check<br/>
  ================================================================<br/>
</tt></blockquote>

<p>The <tt>oink-stack</tt> repository has a meta-configure file that
will allow you to specify a configuration "mode" for the whole
project.  When it is run all of the sub-repository configure scripts
are then called with arguments such that the whole project is built in
one way consistent with that mode.<ul>

<li>The default mode is <tt>fastdebug</tt>, which is what you want for
debugging: the resulting code is reasonably fast and can still be run
in gdb.

<li>To build for performance, use the <tt>perform</tt> mode.

</ul>

<p>There are other modes; for an exhaustive and a usage message, in
<tt>oink-stack</tt> run <tt>./configure -h</tt>

<p>If you have problems with the platform-model tests failing with a
segmentation fault, this seems to often be due to problems with
libzipios++ and zlib.  Make sure that your version of these libraries
was built with the same version of the compiler that you are building
Oink with.  Another solution is to just turn off zip archiving,
falling back to a more primitive method.  Do this from the oink-stack
directory as follows.

<blockquote><tt>
  ./configure +platform-model:--archive-srz=dir +oink:-require-no-archive-srz-zip
</tt></blockquote>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
</a>

<p>Dependencies required to compile Oink:

<ul>

 <li> gcc: 2.95.3, 3.2, 3.4, 4.0, 4.1 known to work.

 <li> flex: 2.5.4, 2.5.31, 2.5.33 known to work.

 <li> bison: 1.35, 2.1, 2.3 known to work.

</ul>

<p>The following are optional; you get extended functionality if you
have them.

<ul>

 <li> dot: 1.8.10, 2.7 known to work; Get dot from here: <a
 href="http://www.graphviz.org/">http://www.graphviz.org/</a>.  You do
 not need dot for the base functionality of the system.  If we have an
 internal graph to print out, such as the output of
 -fq-print-quals-graph, it will be rendered out in dot format and you
 will need dot to convert that to postscript.

 <li> gcc-3.4 to use platform-model for C++ (Elsa does not support STL
   headers from g++ 4.0 or g++ 3.3; please
   see <tt>platform-model/doc/gcc.txt</tt>.</li>

 <li> libzipios++ and zlib: libzipios++ 0.1.5.9 known to work, zlib 1.2.3
      known to work.  Enable loading and saving .qz archive
   files, in addition to .qdir archive directories.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The oink-stack/platform-model repository is built by default so
the out-of-the-box build will fail unless you have gcc-3.4.</b>
If you don't have gcc-3.4, you can just hack oink-stack/Makefile to not
build platform-model, but then you will have to provide your own
annotations for the platform libraries.  If the parts of your code
that talk to external libraries are small, you can annotate them
instead and you might get along just fine.  You will also have to use
raw oink-stack/oink/qual instead of the wrapper script
oink-stack/oink-scripts/bin/qualx.

<a name=tools>
<h2>Tools of Oink</h2>
</a>

<p>Oink is a framework in which to build tools.  To make Oink easy to
learn and build-upon, I have written some small examples.  Each sample
tool is a stand-alone executable and does not share infrastructure
with other unrelated tools, making it smaller and easier to
understand.  Oink also provides the Cqual++ tool, a polymorphic
whole-program dataflow analysis for C++.

<h3>Oink tool</h3>

<p>The Oink tool, oink/oink, is the empty analysis: it does nothing.
Its features and command-line flags are shared by all other tools.
For an exhaustive list of the oink/oink flags and a short description
of each, just type: <tt>./oink --help</tt>

<h3>StaticPrint tool</h3>

<p>The StaticPrint tool, oink/staticprint, is intended to print out
various facts about a program that can be obtained statically.
Currently it prints the inheritance tree and a histogram of AST nodes.
Run 'make staticprint-check-print' and then view
Test/staticprint1.cc.ihg.dot.ps in a postscript viewer and compare
with the source code in Test/staticprint1.cc.  See the
<code>staticprint_test.incl.mk</code> makefile for other examples.
Note that currently this tree is translation-unit-local since
staticprint has no linker imitator.

<h3>DfgPrint tool</h3>

<p>The Dfgprint tool, oink/dfgprint, prints the data flow graph of a
C++ program.  It is purposefully small and simple so it is easy to see
the essentials of writing a dataflow tool.  It should be easy to get
started on a dataflow analysis by simply copying dfgprint and hacking
it.  Run 'make dfgprint-check-print' and then view
Test/dfgprint1.c.dfg.dot.ps in a postscript viewer and compare with
the source code in Test/dfgprint1.c .  Note that the graph generation
requires that you have the graph layout program 'dot'.

<p>Note that dfgprint prints 'expression-level' dataflow.  The
dataflow used by the Cqual++ analysis (described below) is the more
detailed 'type-level' flow; you can get a graph of that flow by
running Cqual++ with the flag -fprint-quals-graph and then running
'dot' on the resulting quals.dot file.

<h3>CfgPrint tool</h3>

<p>The Cfgprint tool, oink/cfgprint, prints the intra-procedural
control flow graph of a C++ program (by delegating to that
functionality in Elsa).  Similarly to dfgprint it also is purposefully
small and simple.  Run 'make cfgprint-check-print' and then view
Test/cfgprint1.c.cfg.dot.ps in a postscript viewer and compare with
the source code in Test/cfgprint1.c .

<p>Note that cfgprint prints a statement-level control flow graph; a
more precise expression-level graph could be implemented as (mostly) a
refinement of the statement-level flow, but this is not done yet.  (It
would not be a strict refinement due to the possibility of using a
goto to jump out of a gnu expression statement; Yes there is an
example of this in the Red Hat 9 source tree.)  We don't compute the
(inter-procedural) call graph as to do that properly really requires
including also a points-to analysis and a dataflow analysis.

<a name=qual>
<h3>Cqual++ tool [<a href="qual.html">further documentation</a>]</h3>
</a>

<p>
  The major tool of the current Oink distribution is Cqual++,
  oink/qual, which checks static assertions about C++ programs that
  can be expressed as a polymorphic dataflow of type qualifiers.
  Cqual++ uses libqual to do the inference.  Please see the <a
  href="qual.html">Cqual++ Documentation</a> for more information.
