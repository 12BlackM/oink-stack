command-line flag summary below, except that it will be preceded by
the oink --help output, which is documented <a href=oink_help.html>on
its own page</a>.  On this page I expand on the meaning of the various
flags.

<h3>Help output</h3>

<p>Note that the defaults can be found in oink/qual_cmd.cc; look for
the constructor which starts QualCmd::QualCmd(); flag names have their
'-q-' or '-fq-' prefix removed and have their dashes replace with
underscores.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
qual/legacy-cqual flags that take an argument:

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-q-config FILE           : set the configuration file to FILE
                               (can also set $QUALCC_CONFIG)
</font></b></pre>

<p>Cqual++ allows users to annotate the dataflow with various "colors"
or qualifier literals.  Cqual++ can flow these colors around in the
dataflow graph, but it needs to know what the semantics are when two
colors meet: is it an error, or do they turn into a third color, etc.
The semantics is defined in a configuration file given to this
command-line argument.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-q-hotspots NUM          : set the number of hotspots to NUM
</font></b></pre>

<p>This is some ancient flag internal to libqual; ask Rob Johnson or
Jeff Foster what it means.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
qual/legacy-cqual boolean flags; precede by '-fq-no-' for the negative sense.

<p>Note that, as with the Oink flags, the default may be the 'no'
version of the flag.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-print-quals-graph    : print out quals.dot of inference graph
</font></b></pre>

<p>If you are debugging the dataflow graph, it is sometimes helpful to
be able to see it visually.  If you set this flag, a quals.dot file
will be produced in the local directory.  This file can be given to
the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">'dot'</a> program which will
produce a human-readable post-script file of the graph.  This is only
useful on small examples or the graph is simply unreadable; to help
with this problem, before sending it to dot, the graph can be filtered
down to one connected component by using the script
'qual_graph_component'.  This makefile target in
oink/qual_result_test.incl.mk shows how to use them all together.

<pre>
TEST_TOCLEAN += *.dot
TEST_TOCLEAN += *.ps

qual-graph:

</pre>

<p>You probably want to use <b>-fq-name-with-loc</b> with this flag to
print out the source location information in each node.  The resulting
graph is much easier to follow as you can just look for source
location line number changes instead of following the tedious details
of each expression's node.  In fact, it would be useful to have a
utility that would squash together adjacent nodes in the graph that
all have the same source location information, which would serve the
same purpose.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-strict-const         : enforce const, rather than allow const inference
</font></b></pre>

<p>There is a qualifier called 'const' that can be used to annotate
types in C and C++.  Const is just a special case of the kind of type
qualifier that Cqual++ implements.  With a usual C or C++ compiler,
const does not 'flow' automatically: the programmer must manually
annotate const everywhere that it is needed or else there will be an
error.  With this flag on, Cqual++ behaves just as a normal C or C++
compiler in this respect.  The alternative is that const would be
flowed just as any other qualifier and so the programmer could use
const but not have to type it everywhere.  <b>Note:</b> I haven't ever
used this flag so who knows if this still works.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-casts-preserve       : don't notify the libqual backend about flow through a cast
</font></b></pre>

<p>Cqual++ uses the type-system as a model of your program.  Casts
break the type-system and so also break the model and are therefore
generally a problem for Cqual++.  The libqual backend knows about
casts and whether the dataflow should flow through them or not
depending on the properties of the qualifier lattice that is being
used; see <b>-q-config FILE</b> above for how the config file is
supplied.  Sometimes however we do not want the backend to even know
about the cast; to do that set this flag.  The only place that it
makes a difference is in oink/qual_dataflow_ty.cc which is quoted
below.

<pre>
void mkLeq
  (LibQual::Type_qualifier *src, LibQual::Type_qualifier *tgt, SourceLoc loc,
   bool isCast,
   bool useMI, LibQual::polarity miPolCqual, int fcId)
{
  . . .
  LibQual::qual_gate *qgate = isCast
    ? &LibQual::casts_preserve_qgate
    : &LibQual::open_qgate;
  // NOTE: This is probably an obsolete flag, but I keep it
  // implemented for testing purposes.
  if (qualCmd->casts_preserve) qgate = &LibQual::open_qgate;
</pre>

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-use-const-subtyping  : no back edge below pointers if pointing to const
</font></b></pre>

<p>Cqual++ puts a dataflow edge anytime data *might* flow.  Consider this program.

<pre>
void f(int *x) {
  int *y = *x;
  . . .
}
</pre>

<p>Consider the following four questions about the dataflow.<ol>

<li>Is data is flowing from "x" to "y" ?  We say yes because bits are
actually copied; you might as well think of x and y as ints instead of
pointers.

<li>Is data flowing from "y" to "x" ?  We say no because "x" is really
unaffected by the fact that it has just been copied to "y".

<li>Is data flowing from "*x" to "*y" ?  Immediately, no, but we say
yes because although "*x" wasn't copied to "*y", a later *read* from
"*y" *could* give the value of "*x", and definitely would unless
something changes in between.

<li>Now, is data flowing from "*y" to "*x" ?  Immediately, no, but we
say yes because recall that "*y" is an L-value (for C programmers) or
a reference (for C++ programmers).  That is, "*y" can be written to,
and a later *write* to "*y" *could* change the value of "*x", and
definitely would unless something changes in between.

<p>Unless one thing: unless "*y" is const.  In this case "*y" cannot
be written to.  Therefore in this fourth case when "*y" is const we
could make the analysis more precise by not putting a dataflow edge
backwards from "*y" to "*x".  Setting the flag above turns this
feature on.

<p>This does not work if combined with const inference because the
const-ness or not of "*y" would not be available until after the
analysis.  However, if a program uses const and goes through a usual C
or C++ compiler, then "*y" must already be annotated with const if it
is const, and so this flag would be ok to use.

</ol>

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-ugly                 : put address of qvar into quals.dot node names
</font></b></pre>

<p>Use this flag when using <b>-fq-print-quals-graph</b> above so that
two variables with the same name show up as distinct nodes in the
'dot' output.  It is off by default in Jeff Foster's Cqual, but I have
broken tradition and turned it on as it is very confusing to see a
graph where two nodes have been accidentally merged.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-poly                 : do polymorphic analysis
</font></b></pre>

<p>Consider this example.

<pre>
int identity(int a) {return a;}

void f() {
  int $tainted x;
  int y = identity(x);
}

void g() {
  int x2;
  int $untainted y2 = identity(x2);
}
</pre>

<p>This program is, in reality, quite fine; that is, we can just tell
from looking at it that at runtime $tainted cannot flow to $untainted.

<p>However, a simple-minded analysis will think that something is
wrong.  It will flow the $tainted x from the first call to 'identity'
in 'f' into the 'a' in 'identity' and then return it to *all* of the
call sites to identity.  In particular, it will return it to the
second call to 'identity' in g(), where the $tainted will flow into
$untainted y2.  This is a false positive report of an error.

<p>This behavior is what Jeff Foster's original Cqual did; it is
called a monomorphic dataflow, which is the kind of dataflow you
expect if you just look at a program and draw arrows where you think
data is flowing.

<p>Now instead imagine being more clever.  Whenever we flow data down
into a function call, let's label the edge of the flow graph with an
open-parenthesis; similarly when data flows back up at a function
return, we will use a close-parenthesis.  Further, number each call
site to a function and number all of the open and close parentheses
generated at that call site with the same number.  In particular it is
important that two different call sites to the same function generate
parentheses of different numbers.

<p>Now when we find a path in the dataflow graph from $tainted to
$untainted, we do not count it as a legal path unless the string of
parentheses along the path 1) is balanced: closes match opens, and 2)
when a close matches an open, they have the same call-site number.
Finding such paths is called in general Context Free Reachability in a
graph.  As you can see, this feature would prevent the false positive
above.

<p>The monomorphic analysis we started with generated too many false
positive for Rob Johnson, so he implemented the context free
reachability refinement above, which when applied to dataflow and
function call sites is called polymorphic dataflow analysis.  His
polymorphic backend is what we use in Cqual++ and is in
oink-stack/libqual.  It can be used in monomorphic mode or polymorphic
mode; to get polymorphic mode, turn on this flag.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
qual flags that take an argument:
</font></b></pre>

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-q-catch-qual QLIT       : attach qualifier literal QLIT to the global exception var
</font></b></pre>

<p>All thrown exceptions flow into one global exception variable.  You
may ask why we don't just match up the throws and catches, but this is
harder than you might think so this is the approximation we have for
now.  You can annotate the global exception variable with a qualifier
literal by passing that literal on the command line using this flag.
For example, if you annotated it as $untainted, you would find any
possibility of $tainted qualifiers flowing into the expression of a
throw.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-q-max-errors            : max errors to print; 0 for unlimited (default 80)
</font></b></pre>

<p>Cqual++ attempts to combine errors and show you only the ones you
are mostly likely to want to see, which I think is just the shortest
paths that don't overlap each other.  This flag allows you to limit
the number of errors that Cqual++ will print in case you are just
getting too many overall.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
qual boolean flags; preceded by '-fq-no-' for the negative sense.
</font></b></pre>

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-inference            : do inference
</font></b></pre>

<p>You may at times want to run Cqual++ without it actually doing any
inference; you can use the negative version of this flag to turn
inference off; it is of course on by default.

<p>If you are not doing inference the main difference on the behavior
of Cqual++ is that the low-level functions which normally send
dataflow edges to the libqual backend, 'mkLeq' and 'unify' in
oink/qual_dataflow_ty.cc, instead do not send anything to the backend.

<p>If you are doing inference, a configure file must be supplied using
<b>-q-config FILE</b> above; otherwise, one is not needed.  

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-print-trans-qual     : in pretty printing, annotate inferred qualifiers
</font></b></pre>

<p>If you use <b>-fo-pretty-print</b> and you do inference with
qualifiers then when the file is pretty-printed back out the
consequences of transitive qualifier flow will be annotated on all of
the expressions.  The syntax used is the gcc __attribute__(()) syntax
so they should be parse-able by other tools (such as CIL when it is a C
program; see below).  Note that the qualifier literals used in the
printed attributes are an extended format beyond just annotations with
$tainted or $untainted.  For example a variable may be annotated as
"GE_tainted" which means it is greater than or equal to $tainted in
the lattice; similarly for "LE_" as less than or equal to and "EQ_"
for equal to.

<p>This feature was used in the paper "Scrash: A System for Generating
Secure Crash Information" mentioned on the main oink page.  The
authors annotated any user-private data with $tainted and then used
Cqual++ -fo-pretty-print -fq-print-trans-qual to flow the
$tainted-ness around and print the program back out.  They then used
another tool, CIL (which only works on C; this was a C program), to
modify the program to keep all the user-private data in a special
section of the heap.  If the program crashed before sending a crash
report to the developers, this section of the heap could be cleared,
preventing user-private data from being disclosed while still
providing information on the failed program state to the developers
for debugging purposes.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-name-expressions     : name expressions
-fq-name-vars            : name variables
-fq-name-if-missing      : name otherwise unnamed objects
-fq-names                : control all other -fq-name flags
</font></b></pre>

<p>When Cqual++ reports an error to the user it is in the form of a
path from an expression annotated with one qualifier, say $tainted, to
another, say $untainted.  The nodes along this path can be expressions
or variables.  This path will always have source locations for such
path nodes, but they can also be annotated with a pretty-print of an
expression or the name of a type variable.

<p>Note that the names name specific parts of a type tree and so are
more refined than the usual names of, say, variables containing C
data.  Consider this program.

<pre>
void f() {
  int *x;
  ... x ...
}
</pre>

The expression x has really three type variables associated with it.
We list them below and also the refined names that they are given in
Cqual++ output. <ol>

<li><b>x</b>: x as an L-value or reference,

<li><b>x'</b>: x as an R-value pointer data value, this turns out to be the same
as *x as an L-value or or reference to integer data value, and

<li><b>x''</b>: *x as an R-value integer value.

</ol>

<p>

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-casts-preserve-below-functions : -fcasts-preserve works below functions
</font></b></pre>

<p>It is a big space saving in the backend if we can omit naming
qualifier variables ("qvars") in the dataflow graph; however doing
that makes the output less readable.  These flags control exactly when
qvars get names.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-flow-compoundUp      : insert var to container edges
-fq-flow-compoundDown    : insert container to var edges
-fq-flow-pointUp         : insert value to pointer/array edges
-fq-flow-pointDown       : insert pointer/array to value edges
-fq-flow-refUp           : insert value to ref edges
-fq-flow-refDown         : insert ref to value edges
</font></b></pre>

<p>Sometimes you might want dataflow edges to flow between a container
and what it contains.  For the purposes of Oink dataflow there are
three kinds of such container/contained relationships: <ul>

<li>A compound type (a struct, class, or union) and its members,

<li>A pointer (or array) and the thing pointed to, and

<li>A reference and the thing referenced.

</ul>

<p>The flags above specify respectively which kind of container
relationship and which way the edges should flow.  Any combination is
possible; you just get more edges.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-explain-errors       : print bad dataflow path when one is found
</font></b></pre>

<p>When this flag is set, which it is by default, then the path from
the $tainted to the $untainted will be printed to the console.  It is
off by default for most of the Cqual++ tests.  Most of these tests are
small corner-case situations where there is only one way for the path
from $tainted to $untainted to connect and we just want to know that
it does or doesn't as the case should be.  By turning this flag off
the tests run faster and produce much less output.

<p>The syntax of the path has been carefully done to attempt to match
that of gcc output so that if you look at it in compile mode in emacs
you can just say C-x backtick and emacs will take you from one point
in the path to the next, just as you can go from one compiler error to
the next when compiling with gcc.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-ret-inf              : return the inference result in the exit code
</font></b></pre>

<p>When a bad dataflow path is found, such as $tainted flowing to
$untainted, Cqual++ will return with exit code 32.  This makes it easy
to write tests where all you want to know is that the dataflow path
connects or does not.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-name-with-loc        : put location info on qualifier variable names
</font></b></pre>

<p>If this flag is on, source location information is printed in the
qualifier name itself.  This is not normally needed as the source
location is already printed in any bad path shown to the user, per
<b>-fq-explain-errors</b> above.  However, if you are using
<b>-fq-print-quals-graph</b> you want to also use this flag; see the
discussion at the documentation for that flag.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-merge-ref-ptr-qvars  : merge qvars of refs and ptrs (vs unify)
</font></b></pre>

<p>This flag controls a very technical detail that most users can
ignore.  Every AbstractValue node "x" that is L-valuable (C
terminology) or has a reference (C++ terminology) gets a separate
reference AbstractValue node that points at "x".  However, if there is
also a pointer pointing at "x" then the pointer gets an AbstractValue
node pointing at it as well.  This reference and pointer should be
merged so that <a
href=qual.html#ref-and-value-level-qualifiers>certain kinds of
dataflow analyses called "reference level" analyses</a> (such as const
analysis) are done correctly.  See the example in
<b>-fq-use-const-subtyping</b>.  This flag controls how this merging
is done in the backend: I think if the nodes are unified they show up
as the same node in the qual.dot graph (<b>-fq-print-quals-graph</b>)
and if they are just merged then they show up as two nodes and the
edge between them shows up.  I think I just put this in for debugging.

<pre><b><font size=+1>
-fq-compactify-graph     : compactify graph before serialization
-fq-compactify-graph=always : compactify graph even if not serializing
</font></b></pre>

<p>Serialization allows you to mirror the build process: you can
analyze or "compile" each .i file into a .qz file (or .qdir) and then
"link" them together.  The reason we did this in the first place was
that Rob Johnson wanted to analyze the whole Linux kernel and we
couldn't fit that in memory.  By serializing the graph and reading it
back in, we just have the graph, the AbstractValues and the Types, the
AST and other artifacts of parsing and typechecking are gone.

<p>However, what we really care about isn't the dataflow graph in the
.qz file: what we really care about is the implied connections (or
not) that it provides between the external symbols in the file.  If
another graph provides the same connections between external symbols,
it is just as good.  If that other graph is smaller, it is even
better.  Rob found that by doing a bunch of local graph compaction
steps that clearly preserved locally the connectivity of a a path
without introducing new connectivity, that he was able to get the
graph to be about a factor of ten smaller.  These flags control that
process.  You can turn it off just in case you think there is a bug
and you want to test if it is in the compactify stage.
