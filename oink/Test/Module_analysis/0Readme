This directory demonstrates doing various module analyses of C
programs.

To build each project normally:
   make all -f Hello.mk
   make all -f Hello2.mk

To do a data privacy analysis:
   make -f Hello.mk analyze

To do a data trust analysis:
   make -f Hello2.mk analyze

To discover the public functions of some modules:
   make -f Hello2.mk analyze-func-iface

Hack on the "parameterization" section of Hello.mk or Hello2.mk to
change the behavior.

ModuleAnalysis.incl.mk is intended to be a "makefile library" for
client makefile such as Hello.mk and Hello2.mk; as such it should be
basically re-usable as-is.
