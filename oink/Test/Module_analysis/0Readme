Try out doing a module analysis of a project.

To build the project normally:
   make all

To do a data privacy analysis:
   make -f Hello.mk analyze-data-priv

To do a data trust analysis:
   make -f Hello2.mk analyze-data-trust

Hack on the "parameterization" section of Hello.mk or Hello2.mk to
change the behavior.  ModuleAnalysis.incl.mk is intended to be a
"makefile library" for client makefile such as Hello.mk and Hello2.mk;
as such it should be basically re-usable as-is.
