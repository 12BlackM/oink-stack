                  Readme for libqual by Rob Johnson

Todo:

change the lex/yacc prefix to something other than yy

factor this code and get rid of all the unnecessary headers

rewrite this in C++

stop doing this:
typedef struct Traverse_edge
{
  location loc;
  qual qual;
  dir dir;
} *traverse_edge;




If you get weird segfaults in find_fwd_summaries, find_bak_summaries, then
your stack is overflowing; use e.g. ulimit -s 20480
